# Review-of-anagram.py

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

You can return the answer in any order. Strings consist of lowercase English letters.

Installation

To use this program, you should have Python 3 installed on your machine.

## Code Review

Correctness
Line 5: There is a mistake in the code where the sorted() method is being called without passing any value as an argument. You need to pass the string you want to sort as an argument, otherwise, an error will occur.
Line 6: The sorted() method should sort the current string i, which is missing in the original code. Please add the variable i as an argument to sorted() method.
Efficiency
The original code takes more time to complete, and there are more efficient ways to solve the problem. We suggest using a hashmap to achieve better performance.

## Style
The code's indentation is not consistent, which can make it harder to read and understand.
There are unnecessary spaces before and after the equal sign, which can be removed to make the code more readable.
Documentation
There is no documentation in the original code, which can make it difficult for someone else to understand the code's purpose. It's important to explain what the code does and how it works.

## Suggestions

To fix the code, add the variable i as an argument to the sorted() method on line 5.
Change the empty string on line 6 to i, so that the sorted string variable x is created correctly.
Rewrite the code using a hashmap to make it more efficient.
Fix the indentation and remove unnecessary spaces around the equal sign to make the code more readable.
Add comments to explain what the code does and how it works.

## Revised Code

Here is a revised version of the code that addresses the issues mentioned above:
class Solution:

    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        anagram_dict = {}
        for word in strs:
            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
            if sorted_word in anagram_dict:
                anagram_dict[sorted_word].append(word)
            else:
                anagram_dict[sorted_word] = [word]
        return list(anagram_dict.values())

ob1 = Solution()
print(ob1.groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))

## Correctness
In the revised code, we've fixed the mistakes in the code. Now, each string in the input list is sorted, and a hashmap is created to group the anagrams together.

## Efficiency
The revised code uses a hashmap to group the anagrams, which is more efficient than
